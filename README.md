Our data set comes from the Washington Post and common database which had data from the year 2000.

As of January 1st 2015, the Post has been tracking civilians that have been the victims of fatal police shooting. They have collected over a dozen data points from gender age race, to mental illness. The Post compiled these attributes by searching local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters. The Post conducted additional reporting in many cases. 

The second source has data from the year 2000 till 2019 which had infomation on fatal encounters reported. This datset has variables same like Washington post source.


While there is no easy solution for police shooting fatalities, we believe that analysis will allow for a greater understating of these events. We hope that through this understanding there can be procedural change to how case is handled in situation that have the greatest risk of resulting in police shootings. We will, also, identify the cities/states/regions that have a higher risk of police shootings.
